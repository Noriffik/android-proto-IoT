## Introduction

**Welcome to Proto IoT, an open-source Android app for rapid Internet of
Things prototyping.**

Using Proto IoT, you can:

-  Access sensor data easily and securely from anywhere with an internet connection.
-  Send readings from your device's sensors to the relayr cloud and interact with them remotely through the [relayr Developer Dashboard](http://developer.relayr.io)
-  Add interactions and rules on top of your sensors’ data in order to trigger actions on separate devices via the mobile app or the Dashboard.
-  Build and demonstrate IoT prototype solutions quickly, using just a smartphone.
-  View historical data from your devices.
-  Connect your wearable to the Internet of Things.
-  Trigger your device's actuators.

Proto IoT is open-source, so if you are a developer, take a look under the
hood or connect your own application through relayr’s RESTful API.

## Android & Java SDK reference

Proto IoT uses relayr's [Java](https://relayr.github.io/java-
sdk/)[:target="_self"] and [Android](https://github.com/relayr/android-
sdk)[:target="_self"] SDKs in order to interact with the relayr cloud. Check
out the documentation for more information.
