## Introduction

**Welcome to Proto IoT, an open-source Android app for fast Internet of Things prototyping.**
* Access sensor data easily and securely from anywhere with an internet connection.
* Add interactions and rules on top of your sensors’ data to trigger actions on separate devices through the mobile app or the relayr dashboard.
* Build and demonstrate IoT prototype solutions quickly, with just a smartphone.

Explore the IoT ecosystem by turning your smart device into an IoT sensor node. 
With Proto IoT you can monitor your device’s sensor, send the readings to the relayr Cloud and interact with them remotely through the relayr Dashboard. 
See the history charts, connect a wearable, trigger your device’s actuators (flashlight, speakers, vibrations) or have “if this then that” rules trigger them.

Proto IoT is open-source, so if you are a developer look under the hood, or connect your own application to it through relayr’s RESTful API. Start prototyping!
